summary: >
  The claim that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) broadly “causes cancer” is an
  oversimplification. Certain forms of HRT can increase the risk of specific
  cancers (notably breast cancer with combined estrogen-progestin therapy), but
  risk varies significantly depending on formulation, duration, patient history,
  and whether estrogen-only therapy is used.

The belief that **HRT causes cancer** is a common and deeply persistent myth,
but the real story is more nuanced.

Some types of hormone replacement therapy can increase the risk of certain
cancers, but HRT is not uniformly dangerous, and in some cases it may even
reduce the risk of other conditions. The risk depends heavily on the type of
HRT, the duration of use, and the individual patient’s medical background.

## What We Used to Think

After major headlines in the early 2000s, many people came to believe that:

- HRT is inherently unsafe
- Taking hormones after menopause “causes cancer”
- HRT should be avoided entirely
- Menopause symptoms should be endured rather than treated

For many women, these fears led to sudden discontinuation of therapy and a
general stigma around menopausal treatment.

## When It Was Disproved

In the **2000s**, follow-up analyses of major studies—especially the Women’s
Health Initiative (WHI)—clarified that the initial public messaging was overly
simplified.

Researchers found that:

- Risk differed between **combined estrogen-progestin therapy** and
  **estrogen-only therapy**
- Age and timing mattered (starting HRT closer to menopause carried different
  risks than starting much later)
- The absolute risk increase for many people was smaller than headlines implied

Rather than proving that “HRT causes cancer,” the evidence showed that **some
forms of HRT modestly increase risk in some contexts**, while other forms may
not.

## Why It’s Wrong

- **Not all HRT is the same:**
  Estrogen-only HRT (typically used after hysterectomy) and combined HRT
  (estrogen + progestin) have different risk profiles.
- **Breast cancer risk is specific, not universal:**
  Combined estrogen-progestin therapy is associated with a modestly increased
  risk of breast cancer, particularly with longer use.
- **Estrogen-only therapy may not raise breast cancer risk in the same way:**
  Some evidence suggests estrogen-only HRT may have little effect on breast
  cancer risk, or may reduce it in certain populations.
- **Other cancer risks vary:**
  HRT can reduce the risk of some conditions (such as osteoporosis) but may
  increase the risk of others (such as endometrial cancer if estrogen is taken
  without progesterone in women with a uterus).
- **Absolute risk matters:**
  Many discussions confuse relative risk with absolute risk, leading to
  exaggerated fears.

In short: **HRT is not “cancer-causing” in a blanket sense. It has tradeoffs
that must be evaluated case-by-case.**
